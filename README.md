# DrUUID RFC 4122

"DrUUID" is an implementation for PHP5 of---and associated API for---the data format described in RFC 4122, A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace. It is able to mint new UUIDs, import existing UUIDs, extract information from UUIDs, and compare two UUIDs for bit-exact equality.

The API is designed to be as simple as possible, with an implementation as accurate as practical given the limits of PHP. All other concerns, including PHP compatibility, efficiency and extensibility are secondary.
